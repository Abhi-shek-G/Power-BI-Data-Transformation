The HR Analytics CSV file was then loaded into Power BI Desktop and opened in Power Query Editor for data cleaning.

Irrelevant columns like EmployeeCount, Over18, and StandardHours were deleted since they all contained the same value for all employees and were of no use for analysis.

Column headers were renamed to be more readable, for instance, MonthlyIncome was renamed to Monthly Income.

Missing data in text columns such as Department and Job Role was replaced with “Unknown”, and any rows that had missing crucial numeric data were deleted.

Data types were adjusted by changing numeric columns such as Age and Monthly Income to Whole Number and text columns to Text.

A new column called Age Group was added to categorize employees according to their age groups for easy analysis.

Another new column called Salary Band was added by grouping employees according to their Monthly Income into Low, Medium, and High categories.

No splitting of columns was necessary since all columns already had the correct data.

Once all transformations were done, the cleaned data was then loaded and used to create data visualizations such as attrition analysis and department analysis.
